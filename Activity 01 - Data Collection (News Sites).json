Prior to this week\u2019s adjustment, diesel and gasoline prices had gone up by P27.85 and P18.30 a liter, respectively.\nOn the global scene, analysts said concerns over tight supply due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the Iran nuclear deal continued to linger despite some countries\u2019 decision to draw oil from their strategic petroleum reserves.\nUS President Joe Biden has authorized the release of more than 180 million barrels of oil from the country\u2019s emergency oil reserve for the next six months. Member countries of the International Energy Agency followed suit.\nThe price of Dubai crude\u2014the Asian bellwether\u2014remained at $110.89 a barrel as of Monday.\nAs oil prices remain high, the government has been asked to ease the impact of rising fuel prices on the country\u2019s agriculture sector by suspending the imposition of the excise on oil. \nRosanna Contreras, president of Soccsksargen Federation of Fishing and Allied Industries Inc., on Monday pushed for the suspension of the excise on petroleum products to ease the burden of consecutive oil price hikes on fishermen. Fuel accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the total fishing cost.\nChester Warren Tan, president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers Inc., said the reprieve sought by agricultural producers was temporary.\n\u201cWhat the industry is asking for is to cancel or lower the tax for three to four months to help us cope with rising fuel costs,\u201d he added.\n\u2014WITH A REPORT FROM JORDEENE B.

(Photo from 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command)\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 The United States has deployed its state-of-the-art air and missile defense system to the Philippines for the first time as part of an annual joint war games and a major display of American force.\nThe US Army in the Pacific carried out the first amphibious insertion of a Patriot missile system \u2014 the first time that the United States deployed the system overseas by land and sea \u2014 in Aparri in the province of Cagayan, located in the northern Philippines facing south of Taiwan.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, the Americans appeared to be testing out new concepts for future Pacific theater operations, and this fits into the patterns of their recent exercises around the region.FEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBongbong Marcos sympathizer Querubin withdraws support from church group\u00a0\n\nNEWSINFO\n7k attend Marcos rally in Catarman\n\nNEWSINFO\nFilipino woman found dead in a suitcase\n\n\u201cThe Patriot deployment would specifically imply the Americans\u2019 concerns about augmenting defenses for its forces in the theater against US adversaries\u2019 growing missile threat,\u201d he told the Inquirer.\nTaiwan situation\nThe joint drills also take place as China continues to step up its military activities near Taiwan, which it believes to be part of its territory. Beijing has been regularly flying its military aircraft into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone, and conducting naval and air drills near the Taiwan Strait, located north of the Philippines.\n\n\n\n\nBut Koh believes the exercises in Cagayan were not aimed specifically at a Taiwan situation, although he said there was a possible indication that the United States would use the Philippines as potential staging ground for its operations in a Taiwan Strait contingency scenario.\nHe recalled President Duterte\u2019s recent statement allowing American forces to use Philippine bases and facilities if Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine spills over to the region. The 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty binds the Philippines and US to come to the aid of the other in case of an armed attack.\n\u201cUnder these potential scenarios, the Patriot deployment appears operationally relevant. This is more so considering the Philippines has relatively weak air defenses,\u201d Koh said.\nNot tested for live-firing\nThe weapon system was transported by the US Navy\u2019s Whidbey Island-class amphibious ship USS Ashland through two landing craft air cushions operated by Naval Beach Unit 7 based in Sasebo, Japan.\nUS Marines from Alpha Company, 9th Engineer Support Battalion, prepared the landing site and ensured the Patriot launchers were able to rapidly move to their fighting positions, the US Army said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Patriot\u2014which stands for \u201cPhased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target\u201d\u2014is developed by US weapons manufacturer Raytheon and is currently used by 17 countries. It can track and shoot down attacking missiles and aircraft with a minimum flight time of less than nine seconds and can travel up to 70 kilometers to a target.\nA typical package consists of radars, missiles, launchers, and support vehicles.\nThe deployment of the Patriot missile defense system to the Philippines was part of a mobilization exercise, but it was not tested for live-firing, according to a senior military official involved in the exercise.\nCagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba had earlier opposed live-fire training in joint exercises in his province out of worries that it could offend China, which he saw as a potential major economic investor.\nPrepare and rehearse responses\nThe US Army\u2019s 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command said the deployment of Patriot to the Philippines was part of larger amphibious and coastal defense operations throughout the joint drills.\n\u201cThe Patriot provides critical air defense capabilities and strengthens the ability of the joint and combined force to maintain security across all domains,\u201d it said.\nAlmost 9,000 Filipino and American service members are taking part in the 12-day Balikatan\u2014Filipino word for shoulder-to-shoulder\u2014which ends on April 8.\nThe joint drills are being held as China turns increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, and as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continues.\nThe annual military exercise between the two allies seeks to ensure interoperability of their forces and to prepare and rehearse their responses to various security threats.\n\u2018High time\u2019\nIn the nearby coastal town of Claveria, also in Cagayan province, Filipino and American troops on Thursday acted out to defend an island from potential invaders through beach landings.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s high time, maybe, we never know if we\u2019ll get involved in the unfolding events that we\u2019re hearing about internationally.

Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who was again absent in the debate hosted by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) \u2014 were asked whether they believed it was a problem of people or systems.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first confrontation of the night occurred when labor leader Leody de Guzman, who had answered the question by saying it was a problem of the electoral and political system, challenged Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who differed with him and said the problem lay with the officials running the system.\n\u201cThe biggest problem is the trapos (traditional politicians) and the political dynasties are the ones who keep getting elected in government,\u201d De Guzman said, rebutting Lacson\u2019s earlier contention that the lack of leadership was the root of the problem.FEATURED STORIES\nNEWSINFO\nBongbong Marcos sympathizer Querubin withdraws support from church group\u00a0\n\nNEWSINFO\n7k attend Marcos rally in Catarman\n\nNEWSINFO\nFilipino woman found dead in a suitcase\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said it\u2019s people who are the problem. For me, the test of character to any official is to offer them power or money. If they pass the test, their character is good,\u201d the senator said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the leader who needs to set the example so that they could fully implement their policies,\u201d Lacson said.\n\n\n\n\nBut De Guzman argued: \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about is the system of election, not of people. What I\u2019m saying is even if the law allows the Comelec to ban trapos and dynasties, they are able to come in anyway.\u201d\n\u2018Take it easy\u2019\nThe exchange was cut short when the moderator, broadcast journalist Ces Drilon, asked De Guzman \u201cto take it easy\u201d as the next topic would focus on political dynasties.\nBy the next round of questioning, it was Sen. Manny Pacquiao\u2019s turn on the hot seat after he defended the existence of political dynasties, without mentioning that besides himself, multiple members of his clan were running in the May elections.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay with [banning] political dynasties\u2026 but remember we are a democracy. People vote for those who get to sit in office. They are not appointed,\u201d the retired boxer argued.\n\u201cIt would be unfair to families who are giving honest service and making changes\u2026 Not everybody steals from the government,\u201d Pacquiao added.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis statement immediately drew stinging rebuttals from his opponents.\n\u201cWe would like to remind Senator Pacquiao, with all due respect, that political dynasties are not allowed as provided by law. Whatever the reason, the law says that the state prohibits political dynasties,\u201d lawyer and doctor Jose Montemayor Jr. said.\n\u201cWe should be doing something about thick and fat dynasties, instead of defending them,\u201d he added.\nBusinessman Faisal Mangondato chimed in, saying the senator was wrong to claim that political dynasties were okay as long as people kept voting for them.\n\u201cThat cannot be,\u00a0 because [political dynasties] are the [reason] why politics is being dominated by rich families,\u201d he said.\nBut Pacquiao insisted that banning members of a political clan from running for office would infringe upon their freedoms.\n\u201cThe Constitution says each one has the right to run in an election. So if you stop them from running, you are preventing them from exercising their right,\u201d he said.\nPolitical butterflies\nThe next question on the party system and turncoatism also showed a glimpse into the candidates\u2019 political savvy.\nVice President Leni Robredo said she believed that politicians jumping from one party to the next every election \u201cweakens the party system because those running don\u2019t look at what the parties are fighting for and only join them for convenience.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as we allow turncoatism, we cannot expect to strengthen our political parties. We need a law to strengthen our political parties and force politicians to join parties because of the principles of the party,\u201d she said.\n\n\nRobredo said it might also be high time to revisit whether the current multiparty system was still working for the Filipino people and entertain the possibility of a return to the two-party system.\nDe Guzman agreed that there should be a law against \u201cpolitical butterflies\u201d with a caveat: \u201cMy reservation is that [most parties] have the same agenda and protect the same interests: for capitalists, big business and elitists.\u201d\nFormer defense chief and national security adviser Norberto Gonzales lamented how easy it was for Filipino politicians to switch parties \u201cbecause they don\u2019t understand what parties mean.\u201d\n\u201cBut if we look at mature democracies, political parties are extremely important, because they represent not only the coming together of politicians but the formation of collective sentiment \u2014 what kind of society do they want to create?\u201d he said.\nManila Mayor Francisco \u201cIsko Moreno\u201d Domagoso, who has been criticized for changing parties several times throughout his 24-year career in politics, said it was time for major political reforms in the Philippines.\nHe launched into a summation of his campaign proposals, including the return of the two-party system, the election of the president and the vice president under the same ticket, a regional composition of the Senate, and an overhaul of the party-list system.\n\u201cAre they (party-list systems) really representing the marginalized? Are they really representing the intent of the law? I think we need to pass another law, through Congress or a people\u2019s initiative, for a change in our political system. It\u2019s high time,\u201d Domagoso said.\nHuman rights\nThe candidates were also asked about their stance on issues affecting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), the plight of overseas Filipino workers, and regional cooperation.\nIn particular, they were quizzed about their take on human rights violations in other countries, particularly the ongoing military coup in Myanmar.\nThe government must first improve its own human rights situation and global standing before it can even ask other nations, like Myanmar, to observe international treaties on human rights, De Guzman and Pacquiao said, even as other candidates asserted that the Philippines must take the lead in demanding that these nations observe international obligations.\n\n\nBoth De Guzman and Pacquiao agreed that the Philippine government must first prove that it respects the rights of Filipinos or it would not have the credibility to speak on such matters.\n\u201cThe government will not have the moral credibility to speak on such matters if it itself is the prime violator of human rights,\u201d De Guzman said, alluding to the numerous violations flagged under President Duterte\u2019s twin war on drugs and insurgency. \u201cOur country must first have a government that will protect human rights before it can have a standing before Asean nations.\u201d \nFor Pacquiao, it was hard to make a suggestion \u201cto other countries on issues like this when our own country [does] not have a good image or reputation [before the world].\u201d\nLacson and Domagoso, meanwhile, pushed for a more proactive approach to the problem and argued that the Philippines must lead the charge in asking other nations to observe international treatises.\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask them because we shouldn\u2019t be the only ones asked by other nations all the time to observe our obligations,\u201d Domagoso said, alluding to how several governments and international groups had repeatedly called on the Duterte administration to show respect for human rights locally.\nRELATED STORIES\nDesire to hold on to power creates political dynasties \u2014 Drilon\nSolon backs proposed \u2018anti-turncoatism\u2019 charter amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnicef: Many children drop out as in-person classes reopen\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuterte uses up intel, contingency funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being in the industry for 10 years, Grammy-winning producer Dem Jointz says he\u2019s just getting started\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina ship \u2018shadowing\u2019 research vessel in WPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonolulu Caf\u00e9 is the cure for your Egg Tarts and Roastings cravings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOH: Daily COVID count hits plateau\u2028\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorre Lorenzo offers a worry-free investment opportunity in Ascott-managed premium serviced residences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST READ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilipino woman found dead in a suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Isko\u2019s withdrawal will hurt Leni\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7k attend Marcos rally in Catarman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepEd\u2019s Manila office sorry about module mocking Leni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't miss out on the latest news and information.   \n\n\n\nView comments\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

Their Ministry of Education also tracks out-of-school youth with the help of local authorities and community leaders.\nIn Thailand, a nationwide effort aimed at identifying children not returning or at risk of not returning to school was also underway, Unicef said.\nMost vulnerable\nIn other countries such as South Africa, Unicef said the number of out-of-school children tripled from 250,000 to 750,000 between March 2020 and July 2021, while around one in every 10 schoolchildren in Uganda did not return to school in January after a two-year closure.\nThe dropout rate among secondary female students in Malawi, a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, increased from 6.4 percent to 9.5 percent between 2020 and 2021 while in Kenya, 16 percent of girls and 8 percent of the boys among 4,000 survey respondents said they did not return to schools when they reopened.\n\u201cOut-of-school children are some of the most vulnerable and marginalized children in society. They are the least likely to be able to read, write or do basic math, and are cut off from the safety net that schools provide,\u201d Unicef said in a statement last week.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis puts the out-of-school youth at increased risk of exploitation and a lifetime of poverty and deprivation, the humanitarian organization added.\nUnicef also noted that with the current \u201cslow learning pace,\u201d most schoolchildren would take seven years to learn basic reading skills and 11 years for foundational numeracy skills, which should have been grasped in two years.\nAs the public health crisis enters its third year, Unicef said that 23 countries catering to around 405 million learners were yet to fully reopen their schools, \u201cwith many schoolchildren at risk of dropping out.\u201d\n\u201cThis rising inequality in access to learning means that education risks becoming the greatest divider, not the greatest equalizer.

(Photo by CEDEZ CASTRO \/ CONTRIBUTOR)\nPUERTO PRINCESA CITY, Palawan, Philippines \u2014Former Palawan Gov. Joel Reyes, the principal suspect in the 2011 murder of environmentalist and hard-hitting broadcaster Gerry Ortega, emerged in public for the first time in years on Sunday to campaign for his bid to return to the seat of power in the provincial government.\nReyes resurfaced after obtaining a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 23 from the Supreme Court against the warrant of arrest issued by a Palawan court in July 2021 in connection with the slaying of Ortega, who was gunned down in a thrift shop near his veterinary clinic in this city on Jan. 24, 2011.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was like mission impossible.

Dennis Socrates and four other candidates\u2014Art Ventura, Erick Abueg, Richard Lopez and Agapito Salido Jr.\nOutgoing Gov. Jose Alvarez, who is serving his last term, is running for congressman in the second district of the province.\n\n\n\n\nReyes is accused of masterminding the 11-year-old Ortega murder slay, along with his brother, incumbent Coron Mayor Mario Reyes, who is seeking reelection for his third term.\nReyes explained that the Supreme Court decision to issue a TRO was in response to his camp\u2019s motion for reconsideration seeking the \u201clifting of the warrant of arrest and reinstating the [petition for the] dismissal of the case filed at the Court of Appeals (CA).\u201d\nPetition for review\nHe flew to Puerto Princesa from Metro Manila on Sunday and immediately visited a local church to attend a service as his first appearance in public after his release from detention early last year to serve his sentence for a graft case.\nReyes\u2019 legal counsel, lawyer Joaquin Hizon, said they filed a petition for review of the high court\u2019s ruling rejecting the CA\u2019s previous decision to acquit his client of Ortega\u2019s murder.\n\u201c\u2019Yon yong nakasampa ngayon sa Supreme Court. Habang yon ay pinag-aaralan ng Supreme Court, meron tayong TRO sa korte at sa implementing agencies ng gobyerno (That\u2019s what we have filed in the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court is reviewing our case, we have a TRO on the court and other implementing agencies of the government),\u201d Hizon said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2019, the CA set aside its January 2018 ruling that upheld Reyes\u2019 petition questioning the merit of his trial. The CA then reinstated the murder case against Reyes and directed the Palawan regional trial court (RTC) to issue a warrant of arrest against the former governor.\nHowever, by then Reyes was already in detention for a graft conviction in a mining case in 2017. He was moved to a jail at Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City in Metro Manila where he remained until his release in April 2021.\nOrtega was shot multiple times in the head and body by a lone assailant in Puerto Princesa City.\nThe alleged gunman, Marlon Recamata, was caught with the help of bystanders. His alleged accomplices, Dennis Aranas and Armando Noel Loria, were arrested in the following days.\nRecamata later confessed to the killing and said his group was hired for the hit job in exchange for P150,000 by Rodolfo Edrad Jr., a former Reyes bodyguard.\nArrested in Thailand\nIn February 2011, Ortega\u2019s widow, Patria Gloria, filed a murder complaint against Reyes, his brother Mario and 10 others at the Department of Justice (DOJ), saying only Reyes had the motive to order her husband killed.\nIn his daily radio program, Ortega had criticized Reyes for the former governor\u2019s inability to stop the abuses and violations of environmental laws committed by mining companies in Palawan.\nIn March 2012, Reyes and his brother, fled to Vietnam to evade arrest after the DOJ indicted them for Ortega\u2019s murder.\nAfter a three-year manhunt, the Reyes brothers were arrested in Phuket, Thailand, in September 2015 and deported to Manila for violating Thai immigration laws. They were eventually detained at the Puerto Princesa City jail.\nIn January 2016, the Supreme Court directed the Palawan RTC to proceed with the trial of Reyes for the murder of Ortega.\n\n\nThe RTC denied Reyes\u2019 petition for bail in September 2016.\nIn January 2018, Reyes was released from the Puerto Princesa City jail after the CA upheld his petition questioning the merit of his trial as suspect in the case.\nBut in November 2019, a CA decision penned by Associate Justice Marie Christine Azcarraga-Jacob set aside its January 2018 ruling, reinstating the case and directing the Palawan RTC to issue a warrant of arrest against Reyes. \nOn July 14, 2021, Judge Angelo Arizala of Branch 52 of the Palawan RTC issued the arrest warrant, nearly two years after the CA reversed its own 2018 decision to dismiss the murder case against Reyes for lack of probable cause.\n\u2014With REPORTS FROM INQUIRER RESEARCH\u00a0\nRELATED STORY\n9 years after doctor-radioman Gerry Ortega\u2019s murder, NUJP still pushing for justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenezuelan chef makes waves in HK with tacos\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuterte uses up intel, contingency funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being in the industry for 10 years, Grammy-winning producer Dem Jointz says he\u2019s just getting started\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina ship \u2018shadowing\u2019 research vessel in WPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonolulu Caf\u00e9 is the cure for your Egg Tarts and Roastings cravings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOH: Daily COVID count hits plateau\u2028\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorre Lorenzo offers a worry-free investment opportunity in Ascott-managed premium serviced residences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST READ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilipino woman found dead in a suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Isko\u2019s withdrawal will hurt Leni\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7k attend Marcos rally in Catarman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepEd\u2019s Manila office sorry about module mocking Leni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't miss out on the latest news and information.   \n\n\n\nView comments\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

These are Toledo Power Corp. in Toledo City in southwestern Cebu province; Kepco-SPC Power Plant in the City of Naga, south Cebu; Cebu Energy Development Corp., also located in Toledo City; Aboitiz Power-owned Therma Visayas Inc. in Toledo City; and Panay Energy Development Corp.
